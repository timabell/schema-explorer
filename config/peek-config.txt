# This file configures which columns will be loaded from the other side of a foreign key.
# Place this file next the schema explorer executable and name it peek-config.txt

# Lines starting with # will be ignored along with blank lines.
# Each line is a golang regex https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/ that will be matched against schema.table.column, (table.column for sqlite)
# schema/table/column names are converted to lower-case before comparing with the below regexes

# Customise this file to suit your database (but make sure you keep your copy when upgrading schema explorer).

# Some sensible defaults to peek
name
\.title$
\.code$
\.email$

# Examples:
# ^finance\.invoices\.invoice_date$   - match exactly one column in one table
# ^public\..*\..*code.*$              - match any column with "code" in the name, but only in the "public" schema
# name       - match any column with "name" in the name (but will match everything if you happen to have name in your schema or table)
# \.title$   - match any column called title
# \.code$    - match any column called code
# \.email$   - match any column called email
